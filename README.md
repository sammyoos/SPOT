Skyrim Potion Optimizing Tool


This small app was written to help my kids and some friends with making 
potions in the game Skyrim - and at the time to learn how to write 
mini-web apps for tablets.  Recently we've been playing Skyrim again, 
and I realized the app was incredibly useful for potion creating and 
it was incredibly ugly.

Hopefully I can make it more appealing while still retaining the usefulness.
